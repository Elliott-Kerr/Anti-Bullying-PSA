# This is an Anti-Bullying PSA
<h4>Stop the bullying, it's not cool.</h4>

According to the [National Bullying Prevention Center](https://www.pacer.org/bullying/resources/stats.asp), "one out of every five (20.2%) students report being bullied." That equates to about 66.2 million students being bullied just in the U.S.

## What is Bullying?

Bullying is defined in the Merriam-Webster Dictionary as, "Abuse and mistreatment of someone vulnerable by someone stronger, more powerful, etc. : the actions and behavior of a bully." However, there are generally four core components that can be used to define bullying:

  * Unprovoked actions or threats
  * Motivated by an intent to cause fear distress or harm
  * Repeated and aggressive acts
  * Against someone with less power
  
This definition helps determine whether an incident is bullying or other type of aggressive behavior, such as one-time physical fights, online arguments, or incidents between adults. *Note: Some bullying actions can fall into criminal categories, such as harassment, hazing, or assault.*

### Identifying Roles in Bullying Situations

There are three roles that can be played in a situtaution where bullying is taking place:

1. Ally - A person who is on the victim's side and helps the victim in a situation.
2. Bully- A person who threatens, intimidates, excludes or hurts someone with words or actions.
3. Bystander - A person who witnesses an event or act without participating in it.

More general categories are:

&nbsp;Reinforcers: These people are not directly involved in the bullying behavior but they give the bullying an audience. They will often laugh or provide support for the people who are engaging in bullying. This may encourage the bullying to continue. <br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;Outsiders: These people remain separate from the bullying situation. They neither reinforce the bullying behavior nor defend the person being bullied. Some may watch what is going on but do not provide feedback about the situation to show they are on anyoneâ€™s side. Even so, providing an audience may encourage the bullying behavior.

Now ask yourself... "What would you do?"

#### It's Your Choice

It's up to you to decide whether you'll be an ally, a bystander, or even the bully. Your decision can either have a negative effect on a person's life, or a positive one. In making that decision, realize that you will most likely set off a chain reaction of actions, people may follow in your foot steps. So, it is morally reccommended that you try to be a good influence and create a positive impact on those around you.
